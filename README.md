# Training and testing models on the mnist dataset
This project was done using the mnist dataset available from keras.
The difference between a dense NN and a conv NN in image recognition is quite notable, especially when the targeted objects in the images fed into the neural network keep
shifting and changing position. A convnet would get a much better score than a dense one in this sort of data. The numbers mnist data do not have different positions or angles, so the the convnet would typically still get a better score but not by much.
